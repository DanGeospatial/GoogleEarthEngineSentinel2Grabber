# GoogleEarthEngineSentinel2Grabber

Use this script for quickly downloading Sentinel 2 images based on location, clouds and date range.
Then, automatically export all images from the collection to Google Drive. 


If you have a lot of images within your collection then the script will hang for a bit while the batch function runs.
Just wait a minute and you'll eventually see the unsubmitted tasks generate.

The cloud filtering isn't perfect but it works most of the time. <br />
Requires batch export function in GEETools library developed by Rodrigo E. Principe.
